## üìÅ Repository Contents

- `Dataset_Description.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the step-by-step workflow for:
  - Opening and loading the dataset
  - Visualizing spectral samples
  - Computing average spectra per category
  - Normalization techniques
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and feature exploration


## üìä Notebook Overview

The notebook guides the user through the following:

### 1. Data Loading
   - Instructions to open and structure the dataset.

### 2. Visualization
   - Plotting raw spectra.
   - Average spectra per class, zone, position, or year.

### 3. Normalization
   - Applying standard normalization or scaling techniques to prepare the data for analysis.

### 4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Reducing dimensionality while retaining variance.
   - Interpreting PCA loadings to identify informative spectral bands.
